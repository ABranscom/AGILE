AGILE is an AGI engine written in C#. AGI was the name of the adventure game interpreter used by Sierra On-Line to run the 3D animated adventure games that they released in the 1980s, which included games such as King's Quest 1/2/3/4, Space Quest 1/2, and Police Quest.

AGILE is an almost complete implementation that has attempted to align as close as possible to the original interpreter's behaviour. 

AGILE makes use of an AGILibrary written by various authors, including me, but as the original repo for that is private and not mine, the AGILE repo here includes only the compiled DLL for that library.
